# film-thickness
The total-internal reflectance technique of measuring film thickness was detailed in Hurlburt and Newell (1996).  When a point of light passes through a transparent barrier and disperses into a film, all light beyond the critical angle of the film-boundary interface will be reflected back down towards the barrier.  With a translucent medium (Figure 1) affixed to the barrier, the film thickness may be calculated by analyzing the light ring projected onto the medium by the reflected light.  The diameter of this light ring corresponds to the thickness of the film at the point of reflection. -- Simon Livingston-Jha
